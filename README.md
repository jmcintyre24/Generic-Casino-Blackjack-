# Generic-Casino Blackjack

*This was a project I created for my Programming 2 Course at Full Sail University [The second month of true programming].*

It's a console Blackjack game made in C#, the game tracks win/loss/draw statistics during the game session. Play against the dealer and try to get as close to 21 as possible.
